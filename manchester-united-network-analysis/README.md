# The Two Halves of Manchester United
### An Application of Network Analysis on Premier League Football

#### Background
Manchester United Football Club are an English football club based in Manchester currently playing in the top division of English football, the Premier League. Originally established in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club, they changed their name to the now-worldwide brand of Manchester United in 1902 and moved to their present stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Once one of the most feared teams in the world with the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm, Manchester United have fallen quite a ways after his retirement and currently find themselves sixth in the league table, 16 points behind the leaders Liverpool. After cycling through four managers in five years (as compared to Ferguson leading United for 27 years), United appointed Portuguese manager José Mourinho, but he has fallen short of expectations this season. The team has been characterized by poor early starts and often leaving it late to come back and try to win the game (although not always to victory). This paper attempts to apply network analysis to Manchester United’s passing networks this season to identify differences in first and second half match performances, and possibly explain the discrepancy in quality of play.

#### Data
Data for professional level European football is collected by third party companies like Opta that independently analyze games and accrue data to sell to different organizations for a profit. This sort of data from independent companies is not readily available to independent researchers like myself, so I construct my own dataset by personally watching full match replays online and recording the necessary information directly. For this research paper I choose to focus on two specific matches played back to back this season by Manchester United: Newcastle United Football Club on October 6 and Chelsea Football Club on October 20. I select these particular games as they are perfect examples of United’s continuous habit of coming alive in the second halves this season. United concede two early goals in the first half against Newcastle United but come back to score three and win, and similarly concede a goal in the first half against Chelsea but score two in the second half, only to be annulled by a very fortunate goal for Chelsea right before the game ends. As such, these two games are representative of United’s playstyle, and as they were played in succession it also shows that it is a consistent trend in their style of play.
By watching and pausing frequently replays of these two matches I create an edge list consisting of two columns, “from” and “to”, in which the values are the numbers that the players have on their back. I count only successfully completed passes in which the ball is played from one United player and is received by another United player. I do this for each half of the two matches, and the Newcastle dataset has 538 observed passes and the Chelsea dataset has 293 observed passes. This disparity in number of passes can be explained by the fact that Chelsea are a much stronger squad, sitting just 8 points behind the Premier League leaders Liverpool while Newcastle are 29 points behind. I divide each of the datasets into their respective halves and end up with four total datasets, each containing the passing data for one half of a game.

#### Methodology
I use the language R and the open-source IDE RStudio to carry out my network analysis. I import the necessary datasets and install/load the packages dplyr and igraph to help with data structuring and network construction. With the data loaded I create an undirected adjacency matrix that tallies the number of passes from each player to all other players in a matrix. I create a graph using the data from this adjacency matrix as the weights of the edges, and then calculate the eigenvector centrality of each of the nodes. I choose the eigenvector centrality as a measure of a player’s importance within the passing network. The eigenvector centrality is a measure of the influence a player has, focusing on connectivity to other nodes that are themselves influential, and thus is a representative measures of which players the passing is centered around. After calculating the eigenvector centrality I return to the first step but create a directed adjacency matrix. I subset the 10 highest passing routes within the adjacency matrix and create a directed, weighted graph with just the passing routes that were played the most. I export the resulting graph as a graphml file so as to visualize in Cytoscape. I repeat this process for all four halves, leaving me with four eigenvector centrality measures, undirected graphs, and directed graphs.

#### Results/Analysis
The analysis of the results can be carried out in two parts, one for each game. In the initial Newcastle game, the opposition scores twice in the first half and Manchester United find themselves trailing by two goals to one of the weakest teams in the league. The eigenvector centrality calculation shows that the five most influential players in the half are Shaw, Martial, Pogba, Matic, and Smalling. All five of these players play on the left hand side of the formation and towards the back. The two least influential players are Lukaku and Rashford, the striker and right forward, who play up front and towards the right. Figure 1a visualizes this lopsided nature. Each of the nodes represent the players’ relative position on the pitch, with the highest striker at the top and the deepest goalkeeper at the bottom (this format will be consistently applied through all figures). The blue nodes are the nodes with the highest eigenvector centrality, and the black nodes are the nodes with the lowest eigenvector centrality. It is clear that the players with the most influence in the passing networks are concentrated on the left hand bottom side, and the players playing high up and to the right are not as involved.

Figure 1a contains the graph of the undirected passing channels illustrates this point farther. The edges are colored and the widths of the edges are correlated with the weight of the edges. This means that the darker and wider an edge is, the more passes were given between the two players. The thickest and darkest lines are concentrated on the bottom left hand side, as expected, and the top right hand side contains only weak edges. Figure 1c shows the graph of the top 10 directed passing routes during the half. The network is visually empty as the most utilized passing routes reach just one of the four highest attackers. It seems as though the most prevalent passing options involve swinging the ball around the back where it ends up at 23, the left back Luke Shaw, who continuously gives the ball to 11, the left winger Anthony Martial, who is the only reachable attacking option. It is clear that United are incapable of creating moves that reach the front and thus lack real threat, resulting in a poor first half performance.
