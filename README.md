# Data Science Portfolio
This repository is a compilation of projects completed related to data analysis/data science during the past year of my education at Wesleyan University. Projects range from applications of network science on airline networks to exploring and discovering patterns in data on a FIFA 19 player dataset.

## Projects:

###  [The Role of Airlines in the Analysis of Correlation between Distance and Centrality in Air Transportation](https://github.com/skim09/data-projects/blob/master/airline-distance-centrality-analysis/README.md)
* Network analysis of European flight network with airports as nodes and flight paths as edges
* Exploration of differences in network characteristics if network is filtered by airline
* Focus on geography and centrality measures
* **Keywords** (Python, Network Science, Multiplex Analysis, Centrality Analysis, Flight Data)

###  [Account Half Full: The Association between Optimism and Financial Well-Being](https://github.com/skim09/data-projects/blob/master/optimism-financial-well-being-analysis/README.md)
* Explores whether there is an association between one's level of optimism and their level of financial well-being, and whether it varies across economic classes.
* Exhaustive analysis on univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels.
* Focus on data visualization and presentation for a poster presentation.
* **Keywords** (R, Data Analysis, Linear Regression, Data Visualization, Consumer Finance Data)

###  [Climate Change and Counteractive Methods: Air Conditioning Costs and Differences in Cooling Methods](https://github.com/skim09/data-projects/blob/master/climate-change-counteractive-methods/README.md)
* Application of quantitative methods in economics.
* Paper explores the differences in type of air conditioning equipment and their costs.
* Broader purpose of offering the argument that not taking steps to prevent climate change will end up costing American individuals more.
* **Keywords** (Stata, Regression Analysis, Climate Change, Energy Consumption Data)
